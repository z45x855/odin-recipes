    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package mild taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>5 (12-inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; shred chicken with two forks.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.</p>

    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, so you could use a rotisserie chicken to speed things up.</p>
