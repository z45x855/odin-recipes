A bright, savory tomato sauce and pockets of melted mozzarella atop a hand-stretched, blistered dough make each bite a vivid, timeless experience. blistered dough make each bite a vivid, timeless experience.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients for the dough</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1L of water</li>
            <li>1.45Kg of flour</li>
            <li>10g of dry yeast</li>
            <li>5g of honey</li>
            <li>30g of olive oil</li>
            <li>30g of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, add 1L of cold water, 5gr of dry yeast, 5g of honey and 1Kg of flour. Mix until homogenous, then cover with plastic wrap and poke a few holes at the top.</li>
            <li>Let it rest for 1h at room temp then 16-24hours in fridge.</li>
            <li>Take the bowl out of the fridge (the one which contains the poolish) and add 5gr of dry yeast. Integrate the yeast into the poolish with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Add 450g of flour and mix lightly.</li> 
            <li>Add the salt and mix with your hand until all the flour is absorbed by the dough.</li> 
            <li>Add the olive oil to the dough and mix util it is fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Strech and fold the dough to develop the gluten.</li>
            <li>Brush the dough with olive oil, cover with a bowl, and let it rest at room temp for 15-20 min.</li>
            <li>The dough should now be pretty smooth but it's still not enough. Stretch and fold the dough about 5 more times and shape it into a ball.</li>
            <li>The dough is now ready to rest in the fridge so take a new bowl, brush it and the top of the dough with olive oil, put the dough in the bowl and cover it in plastic wrap then let it rest in the fridge for 24h.</li>
            <li>After that, take the dough out of the bowl and make sure the top of the dough remains always the same.</li>
            <li>Strech and open the dough and press it down with both hands to remove the air from the dough.</li>
            <li>Cover your hands in olive oil to handle the dough, adding more flour at this stage would ruin the flour to water ratio.</li>
            <li>Cut the streched dough into strips and then form dough ball like you would with mozzarella, by streching the dough from the top and sides to the center while keeping the top facing yourself. Make the balls around 280g and seal them by pressing and rotating them with your hands against the countertop.</li>
            <li>Place the dough balls into the container and cover them.. Make sure to keep them 4 fingers apart to make sure they don't stick together when doubling in size.</li>
            <li>Let the dough balls rest 1-2h at room temp.</li>
            <li>In the meantime preheat your oven to 250°C(482°F).</li>
        </ol>
