        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Neapolitan pizza originated in Naples, Italy, where street vendors and pizzerias honed it into a regional icon. Its history is rooted in simple, high-quality ingredients and a craft passed down through generations. A bright, savory tomato sauce, pockets of melted mozzarella and basil atop a fresh blistered dough make each bite a vivid, timeless experience.</p>
